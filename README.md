HangdjinnProprietary mathematical tool for detecting anomalies and vulnerabilities. 

Hangdjinn is a software designed to detect flaws in cryptographic systems, logs, or data streams. 
It uses techniques such as collision detection and entropy analysis to find irregularities. 
What it doesCollision detection: Finds duplicates in hash functions (e.g., SHA-256).  
Entropy analysis: Checks if the data randomization is weak.  
Visualization: Displays anomalies using heat maps.  
Reports: Generates detailed analyses in Markdown or other formats.
